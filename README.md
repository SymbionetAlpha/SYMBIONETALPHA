üåå Welcome to the Multiverse
Destination: InfinityEarth
Symbionet Access: GRANTED

Public Announcement
Attention, Population Generation Alpha:
The InfinityEarth multiversal node has been successfully initialized. All citizens, explorers, and pioneers of this quantum age are now granted access to the Symbionet continuum. This marks the beginning of an unprecedented journey into the heart of existence, where creation, exploration, and evolution merge as one.
